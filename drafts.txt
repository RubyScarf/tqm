Im at work typing this on my watch. I cannot describe the immense gratitude I have for you. Never had I known what it was like to care and love someone unconditionally. I met you online, started talking to you in September of 2024. It is now 2026 and while the majority of 2025 was spent without you, there genuinely didn;t go a day where I didn't think of you. While there were periods where I wanted to move on, times where I needed to cope, I would always go back to repeating to myself how much I loved you. Randomly in my head, I'd think of you and I'd say, "I fricken love that woman" or "man, I love Yuri so much." It didn't make sense for the feeling of lack was so strong. 

3 posters. Enha poster, Katseye poster, Ramen poster
3 puzzles. Wordle, Connections, Simon says
1-2 Drawings. BATMAN in a private island with a yacht. 
1 Short Clip/slideshow. Of funny messages?

POD 2 and 4 are kinda plain 
    2 might just need like audio or some other animations
    4, maybe the hearts are buttons to something
POD 16 NEEDS something
    was thinking a clip but idk what
POD 18 needs aesthetic clean up
POD 20.... A LOT OF work




OKAY WAIT THIS IS ACTUALLY PERFECT:
Minecraft + ARG vibe + shaders + *Contigo es suficiente*???

# 🎥 WHY THIS WORKS

✔ It’s not cringe
✔ It’s not a speech
✔ It’s symbolic storytelling
✔ It feels creative and thoughtful
✔ The love reveal hits harder because it’s earned

# 🧠 WHY THIS IS INSANE (GOOD)

It feels like:
🎮 Minecraft lore
🧩 ARG discovery
🎬 cinematic story
💖 emotional reveal

# 🎵 MUSIC TIMING TIP

Let the song:

* Start at Scene 2
* Swell at “New presence joined”
* Biggest emotional part during montage
* Quietest during final sign

You just made:
**The cutest nerd romance confession format possible.**

If you want, next I can:

* give exact shot list timestamps
* help with shader mood lighting
* or write glitch-text intro frames

THIS IS SO YOUR STYLE IT HURTS 😭✨🎮
