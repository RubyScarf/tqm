Im at work typing this on my watch. I cannot describe the immense gratitude I have for you. Never had I known what it was like to care and love someone unconditionally. I met you online, started talking to you in September of 2024. It is now 2026 and while the majority of 2025 was spent without you, there genuinely didn;t go a day where I didn't think of you. While there were periods where I wanted to move on, times where I needed to cope, I would always go back to repeating to myself how much I loved you. Randomly in my head, I'd think of you and I'd say, "I fricken love that woman" or "man, I love Yuri so much." It didn't make sense for the feeling of lack was so strong.
