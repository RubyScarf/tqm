    I often feel like I don't know how to express how I feel about you. Every time I write you something, anything (be it a  little note or a longer message), I try to change it up a little bit, make it unique each time, the same three words. I have told you "I love you" so many times it 
    almost feels like just words now. But every time I say it, I mean it more deeply than the last.  
    I cherish every moment with you and my greatest fear is losing you.
