I don’t know how you do it, but you make everything feel gentler.
When I talk to you, the noise in my head gets quieter.
When I think about you, I feel like I can breathe a little deeper.

I don’t need you to be anything more than who you already are — that’s the miracle.
You existing in my life has changed the way my days feel.

If love had a shape, I think it would look like this:
soft, warm, steady… and you.
