    I’m really grateful for you.
    For your patience, your sweetness, your way of caring.
It might sound cringe to say you're my home, but I genuinely feel safe with you. I know I'm not the biggest <em>naughty words</em> kind of person, and I don't want to utilize them often, but I've told you this before and considering I've done it way more frequently... it comes to show I feel comfortable using them in front of you. BTW, never would I use them at you. I just feel like I can talk more freely and be more open when I'm with you. 
    My days are 1000% better because you’re in them.
