    Hey Beautiful, <br>
    When I asked you to be my <em>Valentine's</em>, I didn't have a clue all this would happen... 
    I didn't really expect to ask you to be my gf, and I surely didn't have a plan for what 
    I was gonna do at all. I just had to make sure I snatched you up before anybody else did 🤷‍♀️. 
    Now, I tend to go a <em>little</em> overboard when it comes to this, sign up for things idk how to do... I guess I just want 
    to show you how much you mean to me. I hope this little adventure makes you smile :ɔ 
  </p>
