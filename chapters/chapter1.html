    Hey Beautiful, <br>
    When I asked if you wanted to be my <em>Valentines</em>, I didn't think it would lead to all this. 
    I didn't really have a plan at all for what I was gonna do. I tend to go a <em>little</em> overboard 
    when it comes to things like this. I guess I just wanted to show you how much you mean to me. I hope 
    this little adventure makes you smile :ɔ
