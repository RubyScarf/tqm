<h1 class="note-title">Note #1</h1>

<p class="note-content">
These last couple of weeks, its been difficult to write any more of those 
"suwans numerous notes about yuri." The more I think about it, the more I 
realize it might just be because I'm at peace. I'm so happy I get to talk 
to you again. I'm so happy to have you. It's not hard to write something 
because of the lack of things I want to say to you, I wholeheartedly appreciate 
you so much and not just for existing. On top of exisiting, you've made my 
life so much joyful even without trying. Simply by being one DM away. You 
make me laugh, you make me blush, you make me feel special. There hasn't 
been a singular other person thats made me feel this way. I know our connection 
has been rough from the beginning. I've known you for about a year and a half. 
Granted most of that time had been away but even with that we have always 
been able to come back. The only times I've hated everything have been when 
I didn't have you to talk to. I'm genuinely scared of losing you, again. I 
know things happen and I wish I could be there to help you <em>more</em>, 
I want to be that outlet for you. I hope I can be that one person you can 
rely on. I want to be there for you in everything. You are worth it to me. 
I feel this weird sense of calmness, lately. I am genuinely at peace with 
you. You're the reason my days are incredible, the reason I smile randomly, 
the reason I care more about the ppl around me. I reflect that compassion 
I get from you. Thank you so much, Yuri.
