        You are an incredibly intelligent and talented individual. I mean, you study for hours on end, you're
        incredibly disciplined and you can draw, you can write, you can do so many things that others can't and 
        you do them so well. I love your ability to focus on your goals and work tirelessly to achieve them. I love 
        how you talk to others, and while I don't really mention it, I also admire your morals and values. You’re
        a really good person, and I’m so lucky to have you in my life.
