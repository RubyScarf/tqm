                ${playerName || "someone"} understands before the words finish forming.
                They let go.
                The well releases ${answers[0]} at the edge of the ${answers[5]} stone, gasping, scraped, alive. 
                The ${answers[4]} looks unchanged, untouched by what just happened.
                When ${answers[0]} looks back, the well is quiet.Years later, locals swear the ${answers[5]} well still warns travelers—but now the voice sounds familiar. Gentle. Protective.
                And it always asks the same thing:“Are you here alone?”`,

                No heroics. 
                No looking back. No reaching down.
                The ${answers[3]} light brightens, impatient.
                ${playerName || "someone"} screams for them not to listen.
                But fear is louder than loyalty.
                ${answers[0]} climbs out. 
                The air snaps back into place. 
                The ${answers[5]} weight vanishes instantly.
                They don’t realize the cost until later.
                Every reflection shows someone standing just behind them.
                Every quiet moment hums with a voice that knows their thoughts.
                The well kept its promise.It just didn’t say who escaped.`,

                Instead of choosing, ${playerName || "someone"} and ${answers[0]} reach for each other at the same time—gripping wrists slick with ${answers[1]}, refusing to let go.
                The well pulses violently. 
                The ${answers[2]} reappears, circling the rim.
                The truth is revealed:The well does not punish.
                It preserves.
                It binds them together and seals itself shut.
                The ${answers[4]} gains a new landmark: a ${answers[5]} stone where the well once was. No light. No sound.
                But sometimes, when two people walk past together, they swear they hear breathing beneath their feet—steady, synchronized, alive.`,

                Best friends ${playerName || "someone"} and ${answers[0]} go on a trip to the ${answers[4]}, following a road that slowly loses its markings the farther they go. 
                The locals speak of the place in lowered voices, always glancing toward the same direction when they do.
                They warn them about the ${answers[5]} well. 
                They hear rumors about people who've found the well and never made it back. 
                How those who go missing are not searched for very long because the chances of finding them are close to zero.
                The warnings are vague and sound more like folklore rather than danger.
                “Just stories,” one local says. “Old ones.”
                ${playerName || "someone"} lingers on the words, doesn't like the idea.  
                They notice how no one uses the word accident.
                Later that night, ${playerName || "someone"} brings it up again, asking why no maps seem to mark the well’s location. 
                ${answers[0]} laughs it off, calling it superstition meant to scare outsiders. 
                They insist that if people vanished, there would be records. 
                Proof. Something solid.
                Still, ${answers[0]} keeps asking questions and convinces ${playerName || "someone"} to go in search for the well.
                They keep walking toward where the locals told them not to go.
                As they venture deeper into the ${answers[4]}, the land grows quieter—not empty, but attentive. 
                Sounds carry strangely. 
                Footsteps echo when they shouldn’t. 
                At one point, ${playerName || "someone"} swears they hear breathing that doesn’t belong to either of them.
                That’s when they stumble upon the ${answers[5]} well. 

                It’s covered in ${answers[1]} and ${answers[6]}, clinging to the stone like something organic that learned how to pretend it wasn’t alive. 
                The rim is smooth, worn down in a way that suggests hands—many hands—resting there for a long time.
                It looks like it hasn’t been used in years.
                It looks like it’s been waiting.
                ${playerName || "someone"} notices the air turn ${answers[5]}. 
                Their ears pop. Their chest feels tight, like the space around them is shrinking.
                Despite the warnings, ${answers[0]} is drawn closer. 
                Each step feels deliberate, even when they try to stop themselves. 
                They kneel and peer inside.
                Within the well, a ${answers[3]} vein-like light pulses along the walls, slow and rhythmic, like a heartbeat. 
                A strange ${answers[2]} perches on the edge, watching—not startled, not curious. 
                Expectant. The well pulses again.
                ${playerName || "someone"} grabs ${answers[0]}, trying to pull them back, but their body won’t respond. 
                Their eyes don’t blink. The light intensifies.
                ${answers[7]}.

                They don’t fall.
                The sensation is more like being unmade—stretched thin, rearranged, pressed through something too narrow for thought. 
                Sound disappears first. Then weight. Then time.
                When awareness returns, they are no longer together.
                ${answers[0]} wakes to darkness broken only by that same ${answers[3]} light, now threading through the stone like veins beneath skin. 
                The walls breathe. The well is deeper than it looked, folding in on itself, space behaving incorrectly.
                Every step forward shows them something they remember wrong.
                Above, ${playerName || "someone"} is half-conscious at the rim of the well, fingers gripping stone slick with ${answers[1]}. The ${answers[2]} is gone. 
                In its place is silence that presses harder than noise ever could.
                The well speaks—not aloud, but inward.
                It tells them the same truth in different ways.
                One of them was always meant to stay.
                One of them was always meant to leave.
                And the well is patient enough to decide which is which.


                In a ${answers[0]} world, ${playerName || "someone"} found themselves in ${answers[1]}. 
                They encountered a ${answers[2]} that seemed to embody the ${answers[3]} vibe of the place. 
                As the ${answers[2]} led them through the surroundings, they experienced a moment of clarity during the ${answers[4]}.
