        I think a lot about the first times we talked and the first games we played. Like, in DTI, we were so chaotic and silly, 
        and I remember feeling this instant connection with you. You made me laugh like no one else could.
        We were literally trolls for crying out loud. In a game where fashion is everything, we chose to break the rules and wear 
        the most ridiculous outfits possible. 
        I remember being scared of playing Pressure and Doors because I had no clue what these <em>horror</em> games were like. You literally 
        carried me. I would be dead instantly, but I didn't mind because I got to watch you play. And then, you explained 
        everything to me and gave me the whole lore, I was intrigued and played more. Talking and playing with you would be an absolute highlight. 
        You've always been there for me, from the very beginning.
