    I really look up to you. You've been my strength. You've been my teacher, my guide, my mentor. 
    You've shown me how to be brave. You've taught me that it's okay to be different, that it's okay to be vulnerable, 
    that it's okay as long as you're working to be better. I mean, you've gone through so darn much and have always made it out 
    stronger. You've shown me that no matter how hard life gets, no matter how many obstacles we face, we can always rise above them.
    And you've taught me what it is to love someone so much that you would do anything for them, even if it's hard.
